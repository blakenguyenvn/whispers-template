What is live streaming?

        Live streaming is a real time video call between 2 or more parties. Over the last year, live stream broadcasts have become very popular on social media and other platforms where hosts earn money from gifts for their streams. This is an evolution of the traditional content creator monetization strategy of advertisements and product placement on youtube and other social media platforms which require tens of thousands of viewers to actually start making any money. Whispers' direct calling is the next iteration of the one to many live streaming model as it is a more private and straighforward way to get rewarded by offering your time and attention to other users at a negotiable price.

Why host on Whispers?

        Unlike live streaming broadcasts on other apps, Whispers hosts get paid for all of their time and do not have to beg for gifts from viewers. Also, because of our proprietary technology and low overhead, we can pay hosts a much higher percentage of their hourly rate. This provides the easiest, fastest and most profitable way for anyone, anywhere in the world to earn a substantial side income just by talking to someone else.

        In modern times, meeting new friends and companions has become more difficult with in person interaction declining drastically. Younger generations have adapted quickly to technology and moved beyond traditional ways of doing anything. This is especially evident in the social media and dating space where Instagram, Tinder and seeking arrangement sites have all become hugely popular when their very existence would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. While some may have their reservations for paying to talk to someone, it really is no different from buying someone a drink or dinner for giving you their time as a gesture of gratitude. That is why our native RoseCoin is the cryptocurrency of appreciation and our app will provide the best platform to connect talented hosts with generous users. Compared to online dating, Whispers is safer, faster and more interactive. Why waste time on spam, fake photos, swiping and text tag when you could have a real time connection on demand?

        In traditional broadcasting channels, revenue is usually ad based and very back loaded, meaning it takes the host a long time to become popular enough to earn marketing dollars. However, social media and live-streaming apps have innovated new ways for content creators to earn money for their talents, namely through product placement and in-app gifts. Unfortunately their payments are sporadic and opaque, with the best being 40% of revenue generated. We have gone one step further and reinvented the old 1-900 calling model with pay as you go pricing for real time connections that allows us to pass on 65% of each call to the host, almost 2/3 higher than our competitors.

Is RoseCoin a ponzi scheme?

        The definition of a ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or financial trading. RoseCoin is not a investment and we promise no returns for either old or new investors. Also, whispers is a legitimate business with or without using RoseCoin that will be profitable almost immediately. In order to support price stability of our cryptocurrency, we will dedicate 3% of revenues to buy back RoseCoins and redistribute them to VIP users and hosts.

        A digital token is a cryptographically-secured representation of a token-holder's rights to receive a benefit or to perform specified functions. A virtual currency is one particular type of digital token, which typically functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a store of value. Because RoseCoin does not represent any ownership interest in a company, a promise of future returns or pay a dividend, it is not considered a security.
